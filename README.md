Implemented an analogue of the Xen Project’s Dom0 by building an inter-process communication (IPC) service called TinyFile. The main IPC is between the client and service. The client sends filename(s) to the server which it wants compressed, and then either waits synchronously, or asynchronously for the completed file. The transfer of the original and compressed file(s) takes place through System V’s shared memory and queue system.
